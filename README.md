# Quick Replies for LinkedIn

I'm sure everyone is asked the same questions over and over again. Why not save some time by automating this process. Even one spared minute per week will save almost an hour in a year. 4 years and that's a free Lord of the Rings, isn't it awesome?!

I'm not sure if LinkedIn is going to cut in here, not while the numbers of users are small anyway - but in any case we're not adding tricks or changing default behaviour. LinkedIn themselves added quick replies but failed to make them any useful most of the time, so why not?

For any inquiries or suggestions open issues here or contact me via email: [RomanistHere@pm.me](mailto:RomanistHere@pm.me). At the moment of writing code isn't the best, though [react extension starter pack](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react) was used, most of the code doesn't do anything with that, simply moving functionality from its predecessor [HR helper](https://github.com/RomanistHere/HR-Helper).

If it ever becomes any popular and someone but me uses it, I have a few ideas on how to spice things up: adding ChatGPT integration to make answers different, less dry, etc; adding more options and sync between devices.
